# DIJKSTRA-s-ALGO
Certainly! Here is an explanation of the working and implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm without using code.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm: Overview

Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.

### Steps of Dijkstra's Algorithm

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start by initializing the distance to the source vertex as 0 and the distances to all other vertices as infinity.
   - Maintain a set of visited vertices to keep track of the vertices for which the shortest path has already been found.

2. **Priority Queue**:
   - Use a priority queue (often a min-heap) to efficiently select the vertex with the smallest distance that has not yet been processed.

3. **Processing Each Vertex**:
   - Extract the vertex with the smallest distance from the priority queue. This vertex is now considered as processed.
   - For the current vertex, examine all its neighboring vertices. For each neighboring vertex, calculate the tentative distance from the source vertex through the current vertex.
   - If this tentative distance is less than the currently known distance to the neighboring vertex, update the distance and add this neighbor to the priority queue.

4. **Repeat**:
   - Repeat the process until all vertices have been processed (i.e., the priority queue is empty).

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all vertices, the algorithm will have computed the shortest path from the source vertex to all other vertices in the graph.

### Key Concepts

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - The graph can be represented using an adjacency matrix or an adjacency list. An adjacency matrix is a 2D array where the cell `[i][j]` contains the weight of the edge from vertex `i` to vertex `j`. An adjacency list represents the graph as an array of lists, where each list contains the neighboring vertices and the edge weights.

2. **Distance Array**:
   - An array that holds the shortest known distance from the source vertex to each vertex. Initially, all distances are set to infinity except for the source vertex, which is set to 0.

3. **Priority Queue**:
   - A data structure that allows for efficient extraction of the vertex with the minimum distance. A min-heap is commonly used to implement the priority queue.

4. **Visited Set**:
   - A set of vertices for which the shortest path has been determined. Once a vertex is extracted from the priority queue and processed, it is added to the visited set.

### Example

Consider a simple example with a graph of 5 vertices and the following edges with weights:

- A to B: 10
- A to C: 3
- B to C: 1
- B to D: 2
- C to B: 4
- C to D: 8
- C to E: 2
- D to E: 7
- E to D: 9

**Steps:**

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set distances: `A=0`, `B=∞`, `C=∞`, `D=∞`, `E=∞`
   - Priority queue contains: `[(A, 0)]`

2. **Process Vertex A**:
   - Current vertex: A, Distance: 0
   - Update distances: `B=10`, `C=3`
   - Priority queue: `[(C, 3), (B, 10)]`

3. **Process Vertex C**:
   - Current vertex: C, Distance: 3
   - Update distances: `B=7`, `D=11`, `E=5`
   - Priority queue: `[(E, 5), (B, 7), (D, 11)]`

4. **Process Vertex E**:
   - Current vertex: E, Distance: 5
   - Update distances: `D=14` (no update as 14 > 11)
   - Priority queue: `[(B, 7), (D, 11)]`

5. **Process Vertex B**:
   - Current vertex: B, Distance: 7
   - Update distances: `D=9`
   - Priority queue: `[(D, 9), (D, 11)]` (remove the 11 entry)

6. **Process Vertex D**:
   - Current vertex: D, Distance: 9
   - No more neighbors to update
   - Priority queue: `[]`

Final distances from A:
- A: 0
- B: 7
- C: 3
- D: 9
- E: 5

### Summary

Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that efficiently finds the shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights. It uses a priority queue to repeatedly select the vertex with the smallest tentative distance, updates the distances of its neighbors, and iterates until all vertices have been processed.
